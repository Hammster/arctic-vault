# Hi there future being

This is a short note I wanted to leave that goes into githubs arctic vault, which is where you've found this. I'm one of the many developers from this platform that we used to store, manage and share our programs. I'm by far not someone special, just someone who really likes computers and create programs.

Please take care of all this data, it is our remains that will survive us all in the here and now. I'm happy that you found this and i hope you'll be able to find history worth preserving. If possible backup all data as soon as possible and spread it around, this would be in the spirit of this platform and in the interest of every repository used in here.

If the knowledge of the tool git has been lost, search for other projects explaining how to use it and the 'git/git' repository.

Have a good time, and thank you!

Also on a funny note, is IE finally dead?
